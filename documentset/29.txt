<P>  The U.S. Defense Department is considering providing South Korea with modern radars to boost its ability to cope with possible North Korean artillery attacks, U.S. News & World Report magazine said Saturday. </P>
<P> It said that at the urging of Arizona Republican Senator John McCain the Pentagon may soon provide state-of-the-art radars out of Army stocks rather than let Seoul acquire them through the usual channels, which could take months. </P>
<P> The Q-36 and Q-37 radars detect mortars and artillery that have been fired, permitting prompt counterattack. </P>
<P> McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is just back from a visit to South Korea. </P>
<P> North Korea has been embroiled in a dispute with the international community over its suspected nuclear weapons program for over a year. </P>
<P> The crisis eased when President Clinton announced the United States had agreed to a third round of high-level talks with the North, scheduled to begin in Geneva on July 8, after Pyongyang gave assurances it intends to freeze its nuclear program. </P>
