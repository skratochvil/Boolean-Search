<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Albanian court sentenced former communist president Ramiz Alia to nine years in jail Saturday for abuse of power and violation of citizens' rights. </P>
<P> Albania's last communist leader, Alia had tried to retain power by ordering liberal reforms, but he was overtaken by a clamor for multi-party democracy that swamped Eastern Europe after 1989. </P>
<P> His conviction, along with nine former top officials of the dictatorial regime led by the late Enver Hoxha, completed the prosecution of Albania's onetime Stalinist elite by its new democratic rulers. </P>
<P> Saturday's verdicts were handed down four years to the day after thousands of Albanians burst into Western embassies in Tirana seeking to leave, in one of the tumultuous events which marked communism's collapse in the long-isolated Balkan state. </P>
<P> Alia, 68, accused the government of Albanian President Sali Berisha of subjecting him to a vengeful political trial. </P>
<P> ``What can I say? The verdict is unfair juridically and wrong politically,'' he told Reuters after hearing his sentences. </P>
<P> ``But this court cannot do more, taking into consideration the fact that revenge now holds powerful positions.'' </P>
<P> Ten members of Hoxha's politburo were convicted of various charges in December 1993 and are currently serving prison terms of five to eight years. Hoxha's widow, Nexhmije, is serving an 11-year sentence. </P>
<P> Two months ago, Socialist Party opposition leader Fatos Nano was sentenced to 12 years for embezzlement. </P>
<P> The Alia trial was seen by some commentators as Albania's final catharsis after 40 years of grim Stalinist repression. </P>
<P> But it failed to live up to its billing. </P>
<P> Ignoring a plea from the former president, the court refused to have the proceedings broadcast live, and there was little apparent public interest. The most obvious activity outside the courtroom Saturday was a young man teaching his girlfriend to ride a bike. </P>
<P> In his 80-minute verdict, judge Andi Celiku, 25, said the defendants had arranged a luxurious life for themselves, while the Sigurimi secret police controlled the masses, using internal exile to silence dissent. </P>
<P> Those who tried to flee Albania risked being shot at the border, and all religion was banned. </P>
<P> About 100 spectators, reporters, police and attorneys packed the cramped courtroom stifling in 104 degree Fahrenheit heat. </P>
<P> Alia was Hoxha's chief ideologist, groomed by the dictator to succeed him. After Hoxha died in 1985, he allowed the formation of opposition parties and the holding of free elections in 1991. His power base then crumbled. </P>
<P> In elections in March 1992 Democratic Party leader Berisha won in a landslide and soon aferwards Alia resigned. He was put under house arrest then jailed pending trial in September 1993. </P>
<P> Alia's attorney, Kleanthi Koci, noted bitterly that the sentence was one year less than sought by the prosecution. </P>
<P> ``We won one year, 10 percent of what the prosecutor asked. Not bad, is it?,'' he said ironically. </P>
<P> Ex-prime minister Adil Carcani and his deputy, Manush Myftiu, were sentenced to five years suspended. Former vice-president Rita Marko was sentenced an eight year term. </P>
<P> Two former interior ministers Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai were sentenced respectively to eight and five years. </P>
<P> Deputy interior minister Zylyftar Ramizi got six years, former Supreme Court justice Aranit Cela seven years, ex-chief prosecutor Rrapi Mino four years and a former local chief of the secret police, Veiz Haderri, three years. </P>
