<DATELINE>WIMBLEDON, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mark Woodbridge and Todd Woodforde retained their Wimbledon men's doubles title Saturday with a straight sets win over Grant Connell and Patrick Galbraith in a repeat of last year's final. </P>
<P> The Australians -- known collectively as ``the Woodies'' -- won 7-6 6-3 6-1 in just under two hours. </P>
<P> Connell of Canada and American Galbraith made the stronger start with the first break of serve in the first set but the reigning champions hit back to force a tie-break. </P>
<P> The Australians took the second set more comfortably and stormed through the third, twice breaking Connell's serve. </P>
<P> Seeded fifth despite winning here last year, Woodforde and Woodbridge have not had the best of years. </P>
<P> They lost in the final of the World Doubles Championship in November to Dutchmen Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis, crashed out in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open to Sweden's Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman, and earlier this month surrendered their Queen's Club title to the same pair. </P>
<P> ``We took a big kick in the stomach,'' said Woodbridge. </P>
<P> ``Last year was special because it was the first time. But this year, because we've had a few setbacks, it was just as sweet.'' </P>
<P> ``This really is a big big lift,'' added his partner. ``This is the tournament we love to win the most.'' </P>
