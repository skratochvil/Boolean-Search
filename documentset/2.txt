<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Football legend O.J. Simpson bought a stiletto knife with a six-inch blade and had it specially sharpened almost six weeks before his ex-wife and a male companion were stabbed to death, witnesses testified Thursday.  Los Angeles television station KNBC reported Thursday night that part of a knife was found in a waste collection tank at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and police were investigating whether it was the one used to kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty to the double murders, boarded a plane for Chicago June 12 shortly after the time authorities believe the two were killed. </P>
<P> A Los Angeles police spokeswoman declined comment on the report, saying ``we are not talking about any part of the investigation right now.'' </P>
<P> Simpson, 46, who had been described as being ``severely depressed,'' was wearing a dark suit, white shirt and a tie for the first time Thursday -- he was recently taken off a jail suicide watch which denied him tie, belt and shoelaces. </P>
<P> He appeared attentive throughout the proceedings, smiling when his lawyer made points and taking notes which he passed to Shapiro. </P>
<P> The witnesses' testimony came as a bombshell in the ongoing saga that has gripped America for more than two weeks. The hearing continues Friday and then will resume Tuesday after the July 4 holiday weekend. </P>
<P> No murder weapon has been found, but police have previously said they were looking for a 15-inch knife. A search of a wooded area near a Chicago hotel where Simpson stayed after the night of the murders proved fruitless. </P>
<P> Detectives Thursday searched a vacant lot between Simpson's mansion and his ex-wife's luxury townhouse, both in the Brentwood section of the city, but refused to say what they were looking for. </P>
<P> There was speculation it was a hunt for the murder weapon. </P>
<P> Simpson, who parlayed his fame as a football running back into a career as an actor, sports commentator and TV pitchman, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and Ronald Goldman, 25. </P>
<P> The two were killed outside Nicole's Simpson's luxury townhouse late on June 12. Simpson maintains he was at home waiting for a limousine to take him to Los Angeles Airport for a pre-planned trip to Chicago. </P>
<P> In Thursday's nationally televised hearing, Allen Wattenberg, the co-owner of Ross Cutlery, said that on May 3 Simpson was filming a segment of a made-for-TV movie when he came in to the store during a break. </P>
<P> Wattenberg said he showed the football legend the stiletto which with the handle is 15 inches long, and was displayed on a rack on the wall. </P>
<P> The store owner said he left to attend to some business in the back of the store and Simpson was attended to by the salesman, Jose Camacho. </P>
<P> Wattenberg described the knife as having a brown handle made from the antler of a deer and a bronze hilt and guard. Camacho testified that he sold Simpson the knife and that he had appeared before a grand jury hearing evidence in the case. That grand jury was disbanded by a judge last week after he determined that the welter of publicity surrounding the sensational case may have prejudicially tainted panel members. </P>
<P> A measure of the media attention was indicated by Camacho when he testified he had been approached by local television stations, who offered no money for his story, the tabloid news magazine Hard Copy, which offered ``some peanuts'' and the weekly tabloid National Enquirer, which offered $12,500. </P>
<P> Camacho said he accepted the National Enquirer offer and would share the money with Wattenberg and Wattenberg's brother, Richard, a co-owner of the store. </P>
<P> Other court testimony and legal documents Thursday confirmed the existence of bloodstained items that authorities have amassed in a bid to link O.J. Simpson to the murders of his ex-wife and her male friend. </P>
<P> In a sworn statement released as a court hearing got under way, a Los Angeles police detective said a ``man's leather glove containing human blood'' was found on the grounds of Simpson's mansion matching a brown work glove found at the murder scene. </P>
<P> Testifying in a hearing held before the pre-trial proceedings, Michele Kestler, assistant director of the Los Angeles Police crime lab, depicted a trail of dripping blood as leading from Simpson's white Ford Bronco, parked outside his mansion, through the driveway and into the house, where bloodstains were found on the carpet of the foyer and in a bathroom. </P>
