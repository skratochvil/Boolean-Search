<P>  PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat asked oil-rich Arab states Saturday to help rebuild the new Palestinian self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho. </P>
<P> He said that Gulf countries, which cut funds to his Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) because of its support for Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War, would not abandon him. </P>
<P> ``I address every Arab conscience, I address Arabs: 'Where are you now at the time when Palestinians are building the Palestinian National Authority?' I am sure my Arab brethren will not abandon me,'' Arafat told Arabic-speaking reporters. </P>
<P> ``I want all the Arabs to hear me,'' he added. </P>
<P> Arafat, who returned to Gaza Friday from 27 years of exile, said the Palestinian economic infrastructure was completely destroyed after decades of Israeli occupation. </P>
<P> He complained of international donors' reluctance to make good on pledges of financial support. </P>
<P> ``I will be very frank with you,'' he said. ``All promises we were given by the international states were ink on paper, since the signing of the agreement in Washington -- nothing has been implemented of these promises, nothing.'' </P>
<P> The World Bank and international donors pledged aid of $2.4 billion over five years after the self-rule deal was signed at the White House last September. </P>
<P> Saudi Arabia, the PLO's traditional money supplier, has said its share would be more than $100 million. </P>
<P> Arafat demanded Arab and international support to cover running costs of the Palestinian Authority before returning. </P>
<P> He received a total of $60 million for running civilian affairs. The PLO was seeking $27 million more to cover the Palestinian authority's budget deficit. According to PLO estimates, the authority's budget is $170 million. </P>
