<P>  PLO chairman Yasser Arafat met Saturday with an unusual group of front-line fighters against Israeli occupation -- young Palestinians crippled in clashes with soldiers. </P>
<P> ``I started to cry but they were tears of happiness,'' said Mahmoud al-Ashker, 15. When he was 10, Ashker lost an eye in street battles with Israeli troops. </P>
<P> He was among a group of 28 young Palestinians, some in wheelchairs, received by Arafat in Gaza's beach-front Palestine Hotel where the PLO leader is staying during his landmark visit to the self-rule area. </P>
<P> Arafat also met another group that had challenged Israeli authority -- left-wing Jewish peace activists who had long supported dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization. </P>
<P> ``Today we fulfilled a dream in which I hope we proved that our two peoples can live in peace,'' said Israeli actor Yosef Shiloah. ``I came to express my feelings to the president of Palestine.'' </P>
