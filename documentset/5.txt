<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Six U.N. peacekeepers taken prisoner by a Liberian militia this week were manhandled before being released Friday, officials of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) said. </P>
<P> They said the militia responsible was ULIMO, a tribally-split group that had also held hostage two Nigerian soldiers from the regional peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG. </P>
<P> The six U.N. hostages, all colonels, majors and captains, included two from Jordan, and one each from Egypt, Pakistan, Uruguay and Bangladesh. </P>
<P> They were seized by ULIMO militia fighters in Tubmanburg, 40 miles northwest of the capital Monrovia, and accused of siding with Alhaji Kromah's Mandingo faction of ULIMO. </P>
<P> One of the victims told friends they were beaten, refused food and kept in a dark room most of the time. </P>
<P> UNOMIL has denied any involvement in carrying arms into Tubmanburg or in siding with any faction. </P>
<P> Local sources said the UNOMIL offices in Tubmanburg were also ransacked and vehicles seized. </P>
<P> UNOMIL pulled out of Tubmanburg following the incident and information officer Sergeant Jerome Davies said: ``There are no immediate plans to return.'' </P>
<P> ECOMOG reported Wednesday that the two Nigerians -- a major and a military police officer -- had been released the previous day when they were brought to Monrovia by a U.N. helicopter from Voinjama, Lofa County. </P>
<P> ECOMOG said they loooked frail but in high spirits. </P>
<P> Liberia's peace process is badly blocked and elections planned for September 7 are certain to be postponed. Fighting on several fronts involving at least five armed factions could escalate into serious conflict, diplomats and relief workers fear. </P>
