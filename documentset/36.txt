<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police descended on O.J. Simpson's estate Saturday in a new search for evidence in the double murder case as mystery swirled around an envelope reported to contain another piece of crucial evidence -- a knife. </P>
<P> In a surprise twist to a sensational case that has transfixed America, the judge presiding over the football legend's preliminary hearing Friday suddenly brandished a bulky envelop, saying it held material secretly obtained by the defense. </P>
<P> As millions watched on live television, prosecutors demanded it be unsealed but defense attorney Robert Shapiro objected. Municipal Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell compounded the mystery by delaying a decision until next week, after the long Independence Day weekend. </P>
<P> In its latest edition released Saturday, Newsweek magazine cited two ``well-placed sources'' saying the lumpy manila envelope contained a knife. But in an interview with the magazine, Shapiro declined to discuss the package's contents. </P>
<P> Legal experts suggested that whatever evidence is inside is likely to have a significant impact on the case. </P>
<P> The day after the hearing was adjourned for the weekend, investigators again focused their efforts on Simpson's multimillion-dollar Brentwood estate, where authorities say they have already found a trail of blood linking him to the crime. </P>
<P> Police cordoned off the area around the mansion in mid-afternoon, and KNBC-TV reported that investigators had taken away a suitcase. A police sergeant at the scene told reporters that someone had handed over an unidentified ``object'' that may be evidence in the case. </P>
<P> There were also news reports that members of the defense team had been coming and going from the estate Saturday. </P>
<P> Simpson, who parlayed football stardom into a second career as a sports announcer, advertising pitchman and actor, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and Ronald Goldman, 25. </P>
<P> Simpson, 46, has pleaded not guilty and has been held without bail since his dramatic arrest June 17. No murder weapon has been found. </P>
<P> In the second day of a hearing that will ultimately determine whether he stands trial, the prosecution presented testimony aimed at poking holes in Simpson's alibi and showing that he had enough time to commit the murders. </P>
<P> Neighbors of Simpson's ex-wife testified about finding her dog wandering around their exclusive Brentwood neighborhood, barking forlornly until it led them to her body lying in a pool of blood outside her luxury townhouse. </P>
<P> When photographs of the murder scene were shown in court, Simpson appeared to recoil at the sight, his chest heaving. </P>
<P> Prosecutors appeared to be zeroing in on Simpson's alibi -- that he was home alone at 11 p.m. on June 12 , the time defense lawyers contend the murders took place, waiting for a limousine to take him to the airport. </P>
<P> But Friday's testimony suggested that the two may have been slain closer to 10 p.m., indicating that Simpson would have had plenty of time to return to his nearby mansion. </P>
<P> As prosecutors began building their case and defense lawyers probed for inconsistencies, the judge dropped the biggest bombshell of the day. </P>
<P> Brandishing an envelope, Kennedy-Powell announced that it contained evidence that had been collected by the defense and passed on to her by another judge. </P>
<P> When Kennedy-Powell said she intended to unseal it in open court, Shapiro objected, saying it was evidence that ``we have no obligation to disclose.'' </P>
<P> After a brief legal skirmish, the judge ordered both sides to submit written legal arguments on the issue and delayed making a decision until next week. </P>
<P> Harland Braun, a prominent Los Angeles defense lawyer, suggested that the contents of the envelop might be evidence that the defense considered damaging for Simpson. Otherwise, Shapiro would not have turned it over to the court, he said. </P>
<P> Braun said defense lawyers are bound by legal ethics to share with the prosecution, either directly or through an intermediary such as a judge, any physical evidence that might be incriminating for their clients. </P>
