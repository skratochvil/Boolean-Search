<DATELINE>CAIRO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  PLO leader Yasser Arafat arrived in Cairo Friday to begin the final stages of his historic journey to the Palestinian self-rule area of Gaza saying he was going home to the first free area of Palestinian land. </P>
<P> ``The last time I left I was there in Palestine secretly. I entered secretly and I left secretly,'' a beaming Arafat told reporters as he prepared to head for the border with Gaza. </P>
<P> ``Now I am returning to the first free Palestinian land. You have to imagine how it is moving my heart, my feelings.'' </P>
<P> Arafat, a living symbol of the Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation, was given a reception fit for a head of state when he arrived in Cairo from Tunis, where the PLO headquarters in exile have been based for more than a decade. </P>
<P> Palestinian officials said an ecstatic welcome awaited him from the one million inhabitants of Gaza, which gained autonomy two months ago under a landmark self-rule accord ending 27 years of Israeli occupation. </P>
<P> ``This is going to be a moment not just of euphoria but of tremendous excitement. I think he'll get a tremendous reception,'' said former Palestinian spokeswoman Ashrawi, who flew in from South Africa Friday to join Arafat on his return journey. </P>
<P> ``It's a historical day. The whole idea of the return...but at the same time not all Palestinians are free. I hope this will be the beginning of the return of the rest,'' she added. </P>
<P> Asked on his arrival if he was looking forward to seeing the people in Gaza, Arafat replied: ``Definitely, all my people. I am happy I will be among them.'' </P>
<P> ``You have to remember when I left Beirut (in 1982) they asked me 'Where are you going?' I said 'I am going to my homeland -- Palestine' and now I am going home,'' Arafat said. </P>
<P> Arafat, wearing his habitual olive-green fatigues and checked headscarf, was asked if the pistol he still carried on his hip meant he was worried by threats from Palestinians or Israelis opposed to the peace process. </P>
<P> ``I cannot change... This is my typical Yasser Arafat in the past, in the present and in the future. This is not the first time I am facing threats from extremists ...and it will not be the last.'' </P>
<P> He said opponents of the peace deal had to come to terms with new realities in the Middle East. ``In the past, to speak frankly, we were enemies. But now we are neighbors living beside each other and we have to put into our consideration that a new era in the Middle East has to be understood by everybody. From the Israelis, from the Palestinians from the Arabs.'' </P>
<P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who held a brief meeting with Arafat, told reporters afterwards: ``This is the first step to end the occupation and setting up Palestinian rule on Palestinian land... We consider this to be a historic day.'' </P>
<P> Mubarak had lunch with Arafat in Cairo. The two men then left the presidential palace to fly to al-Arish for an official celebratory farewell. </P>
<P> Hundreds of Egyptians and Palestinians lined the streets of al-Arish waving flags and banners, hoping to catch a glimpse of Arafat when he arrived. </P>
<P> From al-Arish Arafat will head for Gaza by car. Diplomats said Thursday Arafat would travel the last few yards into the Palestinian self-rule area of Gaza on foot. </P>
<P> Nabil Shaath, minister of planning in the new Palestinian National Authority, said Friday he expected Arafat to reach the border crossing by 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. EDT). </P>
<P> Shaath said Arafat was going to Gaza and not the West Bank town of Jericho as anticapated because the narrow strip north of Egypt was the seat of the people. </P>
<P> ``Jericho is the symbol, Gaza is the reality. It's where a million people are. I think it's very important that he goes to the seat of the people first,'' Shaath said. </P>
