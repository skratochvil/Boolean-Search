<P>  The United States and Canada have agreed to resume stalled talks next week to resolve a Pacific salmon fishing dispute, a Canada Fisheries and Oceans Ministry official said Saturday. </P>
<P> Canada has also agreed to lift a $1,087 per ship license fee it slapped on on U.S. vessels sailing between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia coast last month. </P>
<P> ``Basically what happened today -- and Canada very much considers this a victory -- is the U.S. and Canada agreed to resume negotiations on two issues: the conservation and management of Pacific salmon,'' said the ministry official. </P>
<P> ``Canada is lifting the license fee that was on U.S. vessels going through the inside passage (between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia coast),'' she added. </P>
<P> The official said the backing of Vice President Al Gore helped make the salmon dispute a national issue in the United States and smooth a return to the bargaining table. </P>
<P> Gore and fisheries Minister Brian Tobin spoke on the telephone Saturday, the official said. </P>
<P> Talks broke down in May and Canada levied a fee on U.S. ships in mid-June. </P>
<P> About 1,000 American ships sail up the British Columbia coast to get to Alaska to fish each year. Since June 15, Canada has fined 285 vessels and collected $325,000 in fees. </P>
<P> ``Our concern was that the Americans were over-fishing while they were up in Alaska. The fees were put on for a number of reasons, one of which was to get American attention about the Alaska situation,'' the official said. </P>
<P> Salmon from the territory covered by the 1985 Pacific Salmon treaty, which includes Washington, Oregon, parts of northern California, British Columbia and southeastern Alaska, leave the rivers of their birth and range into the ocean. </P>
<P> They return at maturity to their home rivers to spawn, generally passing Alaska first so fisherman there have the first crack at harvesting them. </P>
<P> Canada said Alaskan fishermen in 1993 hauled in six million more salmon than they are permitted under the 1985 Pacific Salmon Treaty, costing Canada about $47 million in lost fish. </P>
<P> Officials said the Alaskans planned to up their over-fishing grab to eight million in 1994, but have now agreed to keep their rate static at six million more than quota until negotiations are concluded. </P>
<P> Canadian fisherman are entitled to about 52 percent of the approximately 200,000 tons of salmon harvested each year in the treaty territory. </P>
<P> Canada's 52 percent is worth about $725 million a year. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. basically has agreed to negotiate multi-year arrangements according to the 1985 treaty ... on conservation and equity and both countries are obviously going to live up to the treaty principles,'' the official said. </P>
