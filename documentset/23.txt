<P> Navratilova won the second set 6-3 to level the match. The American fourth seed took the set in 38 minutes after opening a 4-0 lead as she began to force errors from the Martinez backhand. </P>
<P> She launched her recovery by breaking serve in the opening game and then stopping the rot on her own service for a 2-0 lead. </P>
<P> After a second break, Martinez needed treatment for a hip injury. She lay at the side of the court while a physiotherapist massaged her left leg at the hip for several minutes before play resumed. A concerned Navratilova looked on for part of the treatment. </P>
<P> Martinez fought back by taking the next three games, including another break of serve for 4-2, then held serve. But Navratilova kept her nerve and advanced to 5-3. </P>
<P> Martinez then reached 40-15 on serve only for Navratilova to strike a crosscourt backhand pass before the Spaniard committed three successive errors on her backhand to send the match into a deciding set. </P>
