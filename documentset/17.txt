<P>  France said Friday it would not tolerate much longer what it called criminal propaganda from a hard-line Hutu radio station in Rwanda. </P>
<P> Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee diverted from a Security Council speech on war crimes to urge ``those in charge of the radio stations, first and foremost Radio Mille Colline, to put an end to this criminal propaganda.'' </P>
<P> ``France will do all in its power to put an end to those broadcasts,'' he said. </P>
<P> Merimee did not say whether French troops in Rwanda would act to silence the station or whether France would use its infuence with the Hutu rump government to stop the offending broadcasts. </P>
<P> The radio station is accused of urging people to kill members of the minority Tutsis. When French troops arrived last week on a humanitarian mission, it told Rwandans the soldiers would fight with them against the Tutsis. </P>
<P> Most recently, the radio has blasted the United Nations forces in Rwanda and particularly its Canadian commander, Major-General Romeo Dallaire. </P>
<P> The Security Council has also threatened to take steps against the radio station but so far these have amounted to written statements and protests to Rwanda's U.N. delegation. </P>
