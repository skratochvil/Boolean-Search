<DATELINE>KIBUYE, Rwanda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  French marines carried out a clandestine overnight operation in western Rwanda to evacuate a group of Tutsis being hidden in a presbytery by a French priest. </P>
<P> Ten French marines went to the village of Rutsiro, where Father Gabriel Maindron, a priest who has spent the last 35 years in Rwanda, earlier told them he was hiding five Tutsis. </P>
<P> There, they were joined by four more Tutsis and a Hutu whose life was in danger from the Hutu militias because he had married a Tutsi woman. </P>
<P> ``They had been hiding for two months, in the hills and forests,'' said Captain Eric Bucquet. </P>
<P> At 2:30 in the morning, the marines brought the group down to Kibuye, a two-and-a-half hour drive south of Rutsiro. </P>
<P> They said they met no resistance on the way at the many Hutu-manned civilian road blocks. ``Generally, we never have any trouble at the roadblocks,'' said Bucquet. </P>
<P> The Tutsis are now lodging with the French troops at a school in Kibuye and will probably be evacuated to Goma in Zaire. </P>
<P> Bucquet said that as word of the French presence in this zone got around, he expected more and more people to come forward with information about communities at risk. </P>
