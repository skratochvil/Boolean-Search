<P> Gigi Fernandez and Natalia Zvereva kept their Grand Slam doubles hopes alive when they sailed past Jana Novotna and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 6-4 6-1 on Saturday. </P>
<P> The American-Belarus sensation, ranked one and two in the world in women's doubles play, won their third consecutive Wimbledon title in just under one hour. </P>
<P> They added the championship to their list of seven previous titles so far this year, including the French Open and the Australian Open. </P>
<P> ``It's awful, it's terrible'' said 23-year-old Zvereva playfully, feigning disappointment. ``No really -- it's unbelievable.'' </P>
<P> After a tight first set which the wonder pair cut short by breaking the Spaniard's serve in the final game, they cruised through the second losing only the second game. Fernandez finished off the match with an ace. </P>
<P> ``What a way to win -- it's probably one of our best performances as a team,'' Fernandez, 30, said. </P>
<P> In a carbon copy of last year, they now need to clinch the US Open title to win all four Grand Slams in a calendar year. But from here on in they said the comparison ends. In 1993, they lost in the semifinals to Sanchez Vicario and another Czech, Helena Sukova. </P>
<P> ``I've been saying all along that if we were lucky enough to get another opportunity we would handle it differently,'' Fernandez said. ``We're not putting so much pressure on ourselves and trying to be more relaxed.'' </P>
