<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, NC, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A USAir DC-9 with 55 people on board crashed and burst into flames during a thunderstorm after missing an approach to Charlotte's international airport Saturday, killing at least 16 people. </P>
<P> The flight, which originated in Columbia, South Carolina and was on its final approach, hit a house near the airport runway and caught fire, said Jerry Orr, aviation director at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. </P>
<P> Orr said 16 people were dead, six were missing and presumed dead and 33 were taken to local hospitals.  USAir reported 18 dead. </P>
<P> Rescue teams fought to save lives inside the wreckage of the plane, which split into three sections on impact at about 6:50 p.m. EDT as the plane was trying to land at Charlotte during heavy storms. </P>
<P> Orr said said survivors were trapped inside the tail section of USAir flight 1016. </P>
<P> A witness at the scene said the plane came down low over a group of picknickers and that the group had heard a loud explosion. </P>
<P> Timmy Payne, 18, who said he was about 200 yards from the crash, told Reuters that passengers had burned to death in the explosion. </P>
<P> He said he saw one survivor emerge from the wreckage in flames. </P>
<P> ``I saw a man come out of the woods and he was on fire,'' said Payne. </P>
<P> Payne's mother, Mary Payne, said she saw ``one man who was cut in half. People were lying around. There was really gruesome stuff.'' </P>
<P> Orr said the pilot and co-pilot of the plane had survived. </P>
<P> The FAA's Kathleen Bergen told reporters that ``the plane came in for a landing, the crew determined that it could not land and the aircraft initiated a go-around to make another attempt.'' </P>
<P> Other witnesses said they had seen survivors with ``skin dripping off their bones'' after the crash, which occurred at 6:50 p.m. EDT. </P>
<P> A witness said she had seen people running from the aircraft with ``skin dripping off their bones.'' </P>
<P> ``Their bones were sticking out. There was blood everywhere. Some of them were trying to find their loved ones. They were running, they were sreaming. They couldn't think clearly. They said they were burning inside,'' the eyewitness, Connie Abrams, told NBC. </P>
<P> A USAir spokesman in Washington, DC said survivors were being treated at four Charlotte hospitals. Some survivors were able to be brought to hospitals on buses. </P>
<P> Local television reported people on the scene as saying the plane's fuselage had broken apart and that there was substantial wreckage in the area of the crash. </P>
<P> National Transportation and Safety Board officials were heading for the site of the crash, as was Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. </P>
<P> FAA personnel were listening to recordings of conversations between the flight crew and the airport tower, but the contents were not expected to be available for weeks. </P>
<P> Federal safety inspectors were expected to begin an examination of the site Sunday morning. </P>
