<P>  Algerian security forces killed 10 armed Muslim militants wanted for about 40 murders, including the killing last December of a Belgian national and his Algerian wife, the official Algeria news agency APS said Saturday. </P>
<P> The gang was also wanted for the murder of the nine-year-old daughter, wife, and son of a retired gendarme whose throats were slit in their home two weeks ago. </P>
<P> The agency said security forces, tipped off by local people, raided the militants' hideout in Oued al Berdi village, some 55 miles southeast of Algiers and shot them dead. </P>
<P> Security forces said that besides weapons, they seized the seals of a militant organization called Islamic Armed Group-The Green Death Company, in the raid last Wednesday. </P>
<P> APS, monitered in Tunis, said among those killed was Boualem Bayoud, suspected of heading several armed militant rings and a resident of Thameur village, near Oued al Berdi, where the Belgian and his wife were shot. </P>
<P> Algerian security forces have been battling armed Muslim militants since the authorities in January 1992 scrapped a general election which the fundamentalists were poised to win. </P>
<P> More than 3,700 people, mostly members of the security forces and militants, have been killed since then. </P>
