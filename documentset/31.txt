<DATELINE>GAZA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Yasser Arafat, visiting one of the squalid refugee camps that once bred his guerrillas, appealed Saturday for Palestinians to unite behind him to make the self-rule areas of the Gaza Strip and Jericho a success. </P>
<P> ``My brothers, this is a difficult march, but it is the march of heroes, the mighty people,'' he said in a speech aimed at Arab opponents of his peace deal with Israel. </P>
<P> In Arafat's first full day in Gaza since returning from 27 years of exile, he honored those of all factions who fell in decades of struggle against Israel's occupation. </P>
<P> ``I call on them to help me lift the heavy burden. Come and help me lift it,'' he said in an appeal to opposition groups in front of 5,000 people jammed into a school in Jabalya refugee camp where the revolt against Israeli occupation began in 1987. </P>
<P> In Jewish West Jerusalem, thousands of Israelis chanting ``Death to Arafat'' and ``Rabin is a traitor'' jammed streets to protest against the return of Arafat to Gaza. </P>
<P> It was the climax of four days of protests against Arafat's visit and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's peace deal with the PLO by Jews opposed to any return of occupied land by Israel. </P>
<P> ``We are protesting because we are giving them parts of our country to create a hostile state,'' right-wing activist Israel Eldar said. </P>
<P> Palestinians said Arafat would not visit the city holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims during this trip to self-rule areas. </P>
<P> In the beach-front Gaza hotel where Arafat is staying during his landmark visit, the PLO leader met 28 young Palestinians crippled in clashes with Israelis, some in wheelchairs. </P>
<P> ``I started to cry but they were tears of happiness,'' said Mahmoud al-Ashker, 15. He was 10 when he lost an eye in street battles with Israeli troops. </P>
<P> Arafat prayed at the spot in Jabalya where 17-year-old Hatem Abu Sisi became the first ``martyr'' of the revolt against the occupation that began in 1967. An Israeli bullet pierced his heart on December 9, 1987. </P>
<P> Arafat also honored Imad Akel, killed last December. Akel was in the military wing of Hamas, the Islamic group opposed to Arafat's September, 1993 peace deal with Israel. </P>
<P> Although Arafat drew nationalist chants and raised clenched fists from the audience in the school courtyard, he sounded at times defensive about the self-rule deal with Israel. </P>
<P> ``The deal we made does not please everybody but it is the best we could get under international and Arab circumstances,'' he said. </P>
<P> He pledged Palestinian rule would eventually extend beyond the town of Jericho to all the West Bank, including Arab East Jerusalem that Israel annexed in 1967. </P>
<P> But criticism of Arafat involves more than the limited freedom won in peace talks -- he is under pressure to address the poverty exemplified by the decrepid buildings of Jabalya. </P>
<P> ``In two or three months the crowds you saw praising Arafat yesterday could abandon him if there are no jobs,'' said Khaled Fayyad, an independent economic researcher. </P>
<P> U.N. agencies put unemployment in the teeming Gaza Strip at 45 percent, other researchers say it's higher. Infrastructure is crumbling and needs billions of dollars in repairs. </P>
<P> Many of Jabalya's 72,000 refugees turned out for a glimpse of the leader most had never seen. But Arafat -- always cautious -- for the second day did not move among them. </P>
<P> Palestinian official Saeb Erakat said Arafat on Monday would visit Jericho, a Jordan Valley oasis that gives Palestinians a start in their goal of keeping the West Bank. He predicted tens of thousands of Palestinians would press into the town to hear Arafat speak. </P>
<P> Arafat is to leave for France on Tuesday and meet Rabin in Paris on Wednesday. It is unclear when he is taking up permanent residence. </P>
