<P>  Seated beneath a portrait of Yasser Arafat, the family of the intifada's first victim wondered Saturday whether the PLO leader could have struck a better peace deal with Israel. </P>
<P> The Abu Sisi family, who won fame when 17-year-old Hatem Abu Sisi became the first ``martyr'' of the Palestinian uprising, are not bitter about their sacrifice. </P>
<P> Like most of the 72,000 people in Jabalya refugee camp, they are glad to be rid of Israeli soldiers after 27 years of occupation. </P>
<P> But Ghazi Abu Sisi, 38, thought long and hard when asked if the Palestine Liberation Organization's deal with Israel for limited self-rule had eased the pain of his brother's death. </P>
<P> ``We expected more than that. Our sacrifice has got what we have now -- not a bad deal -- but we expected more, more concessions, more things, more autonomy,'' he said. </P>
<P> Arafat stopped near the Abu Sisi famility's small cinder-block house Saturday when he toured Jabalya, where the intifada erupted on December 9, 1987. </P>
<P> On 8:45 a.m. on that winter morning, Hatem was shot through the heart by an Israeli bullet, the first of what would become 1,200 victims of the stone-throwers' revolt. </P>
<P> There is no plaque to mark the spot opposite a litter-strewn stagnant pool, but the area has been renamed Martyrs' Square. </P>
<P> On his visit, Arafat raised his up-turned hands in a brief prayer before passing on to honor other martyrs. </P>
<P> ``I don't want to reduce the importance of Arafat. We know he struggled and fought,'' said Ghazi, who has been unemployed since graduating from university in Egypt. </P>
<P> But Arafat won only a part of a country, he said. ``What have we got? Limited self-rule, prisoners still in prison and a very bad economic situation,'' he said as his father nodded. </P>
<P> The Abu Sisi family, driven from their village of Houj, near Ashkelon, when Israel was carved out of Palestine in 1948, now consists of 23 people living in four rooms. </P>
<P> The family used to receive $70 a month from the PLO for the loss of Hatem but payments stopped six months ago. The organization has no cash and the family has few expectations of a quick upturn in their fortunes under self-rule. </P>
<P> ``Arafat is welcome here,'' said Hatem's mother, Niimeh Abu Sisi, 60. ``He is one of our people. We have sacrificed our sons -- killed and arrested. Everyone is welcome.'' </P>
<P> But she added: ``He would be more welcome if he came after the release of our prisoners.'' </P>
<P> Asked about the peace deal, she said: ``What have the Israelis given us? They still have our land. What can we do in this place?'' </P>
