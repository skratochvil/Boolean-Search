<P>  Thirteen government leaders from across the Caribbean hold a summit Monday to discuss Haiti's political crisis and the possibility of military intervention. </P>
<P> Washington has been quietly lobbying Caribbean Community leaders for military assistance for any future invasion of Haiti. </P>
<P> But CARICOM leaders insist any invasion must be led by the United Nations or the Organization of American States and only after the latest round of economic sanctions on Haiti is given more time to take effect. </P>
<P> ``Military intervention is to be considered when all else fails,'' Trinidad Foreign Minister Ralph Maraj said recently.  Trinidadian soldiers are now training with British and Dutch forces in the islands of Aruba and Curacao. </P>
<P> Some 200 British troops are also in Jamaica for joint military exercises with the Jamaica Defense Force. </P>
<P> The refusal of Haiti's military rulers to step aside, despite tightened economic sanctions, has triggered an exodus of Haitian boat people. </P>
<P> The United States has been increasing pressure on Haiti's military rulers to step down in favor of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, freezing Haitian assets and cutting off trade. Last week, commerical air traffic between the United States and Haiti was cut off. </P>
<P> Washington has also kept open the option of military intervention. </P>
<P> In addition to Haiti, a regional push toward closer ties with Cuba and the threats posed by the North American Free Trade Agreement will be discussed when the leaders of Jamaica, Trinidad, Bahamas and other English-speaking Caribbean nations meet in Barbados for their annual session on trade and economic integration issues. </P>
<P> Representatives from several Central and South American nations will also be present at the summit to discuss the creation of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), a regional grouping of 34 states and territories, including Mexico, all of Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, Caricom, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. </P>
<P> The inclusion of Cuba in the proposed grouping has irked Washington, which has maintained a 30-year trade embargo against the communist-ruled island. </P>
<P> ACS aims at liberalizing trade within the grouping and coordinating external economic relations. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said last week he would like to see more Cuban goods and services being sold in the ACS market. </P>
<P> The region's leaders will also discuss the impact NAFTA will have on the region. Trinidad and Jamaica are included on a list of countries with which the United States is expected to enter into free trade negotiations. </P>
<P> Smaller CARICOM states are unhappy, insisting that CARICOM as a whole ought to enter into any free trade accord with the United States. </P>
